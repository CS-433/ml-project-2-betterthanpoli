Because of this, air-air heat pumps generally try to optimize their efficiency by providing a higher volume of warm air, and heating that air to a lower temperature (normally between 25 and 45°C). This contrasts with furnace systems, which deliver a smaller volume of air, but heat that air to higher temperatures (between 55°C and 60°C).If you install an improperly sized or configured fossil fuel furnace, it won’t heat your home properly.

Without additional backup heating the pump can produce 150°F warm water with outdoor temperature as low as - 15°F.

This is dangerous: a natural disaster at a site could be a catastrophe, and bad actors could potentially get their hands on the material. Politically, this appears unsolvable.The other problem is cost. Countries that have successfully deployed large scale nuclear (France, China, etc) have federally run power industries.

Try coming into the year 2023 and current technology.', \"Heat pumps clearly make both economic and environmental sense in comparison to old-school electrical-resistance heating. But comparisons to other heating options, like natural gas, get murkier.Most electricity in the U.S. is generated by burning fossil fuels, the “best” of which is natural gas. For most existing gas-fired power plants, the efficiency of conversion from heat energy (from combustion) to electrical energy is around 40%; the rest (60%) is lost to the environment as waste (that’s why power plants sit next to good heat sinks, viz. large bodies of water). Of the electricity that’s generated, around 5% is lost in transmission/distribution, leaving an overall, at-your-doorstep efficiency of around 38%.Current high-efficiency home natural-gas furnaces have heat efficiencies of around 96%, i.e., they convert 96% of the potential heat energy in natural gas into actual heat. So where natural-gas home heating is an option, and where the utility generates electricity from natural gas, the Heat-Pump Question becomes: Can a heat-pump's mechanical efficiency make up for the fact that its consumed electricity embodies a 58% (= 96% minus 38%) heat-energy “penalty”? (Or call it a carbon-footprint penalty.)I don’t know the answer to this question. The frequently (as in this article) stated claim that heat pumps generate 2.5 to 5.5 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed is a useless, nonsense-statement in physical terms. But I’m skeptical. I’m even more skeptical where coal or oil, as opposed to natural gas, is used to generate electricity.Of course, if the U.S. generated most of its electricity from truly renewable, carbon-neutral sources, then heat pumps would truly rock. No matter how much that electricity ends up costing, it'll be way less than the total cost of burning fossil fuels. Until that day comes, and I'm not holding my breath, I expect to remain skeptical.\", 'This is a chicken and egg argument.

Couple that with expanding efforts to adopt clean energy and we are getting somewhere as a society. Neither system works in a power outage, even the gas system requires electricity to turn on. I’m all for steps in the right direction, even if they are not perfect steps. The biggest argument against this technology are coming from states that depend on fossil fuel production for income.', 'The claim that heat pumps generate 2.5 to 5.5 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed may sound non-sensiczl, but it’s valid.

And this is far more efficient than any methods of generating heat.', \"The reason why heat pumps can operate with more than 100% efficiency is that you're not burning something, I.e. converting chemical energy to heat energy. The max efficiency of that is 100% but without properly proving an exhaust for the fire you'd probably die in your home. So there is some heat loss. But with heat pumps, you're not generating new heat from breaking chemical bonds. You are using electricity to simply move heat that already exists from outside the home to inside. Because you are just moving, instead of generating, new heat, each unit of energy spent can be more efficient.\", 'My house has a heat pump and has had since 1994.

It doesn’t matter.As the outside temperature hits 41°F (5°C) and keeps falling, the amount of electricity required to keep cooling those refrigerants and operate the compressor which must heat that air again before it flows into an interior just keeps going up and up and up. That was the experience of a woman in DC when she raised the thermostat from 60°F to 68°F. Her electricity bill went through the roof. So, yeah, it does matter.In the Netherlands, they recommend you get a hybrid pump which switches to fossiel fuel mode when the outside temperature hits 41°F. In parts of Montana that never had gas they use fully electric hybrid models.Heat pumps do definitely help reduce CO2 emissions, and that’s extremely important, but claims such as “energy savings” are a fairy tale. They are expensive to buy, install, maintain and run and not always implementable. A home must be extremely well insulated and sealed for both heat and sound before you can use them efficiently. Another very expensive activity. There’s no way around that and most homes in the Netherlands built before 1990 hardly fit in that category. Just the cost of insulating one of those homes for heat cost easily upwards of €40k, the subsidies amount to less than 10% of the total cost of materials, labor and 21% VAT! But, then again, the Dutch have a funny relationship with money.

They only have problems on windy, cold days because the house is over 200 years old, and yes, they've done a lot of insulating, but there are still leaks.Two years ago, they installed a solar array (from some inheritance money) that provides ALL of their electricity needs, including running the heat pump. They invested in the future instead of blowing the inheritance on world travel or some such thing.\", 'Yes, the 2nd law of thermodynamics really does work. That’s good. But, what, if anything, do they say about the cost of keeping that refrigerant much, much colder than the outside air?', 'One of the improvements in efficiency is the variability of compressor speed. Sometimes mine just slowly turns. It’s not an all on all off motor. Traditional compressors kick on and run at full speed until the thermostat setting is reached. There’s energy savings when the compressor motor speed matches the actual needs being called for inside.', \"That is a property of the refrigerant being used. Todays refrigerants work at much higher pressures than those used previously. These refrigerants produce a much lower temperature when they are dropped from a high pressure to a low one, which is the expansion (evaporator) of the refrigeration cycle. When the refrigerant is compressed its temperature becomes very hot and it is run through a coil to reject the heat (condenser). Because we only have one coil inside and one outside, each coil has to do double duty as both evaporator and condenser. This is accomplished with a 4-way valve at the compressor to swap the coils and check valves at the coils to route the refrigerant to the right place.The electrical energy is used by the compressor to compress the refrigerant and generate heat and there is a fan at both the inside coil and outside coil to provide the amount of airflow for which the system is designed. The real magic is in the application of Boyle's law, also called Mariotte's law, and the the selection of mechanical and control components to more accurately control the flow of the refrigerant.One more thing. Today on residential equipment you will usually find scroll compressors that move more refrigerant volume at higher pressures using less electricity. They can be simple single stage constant volume, two stage or variable speed variable volume depending on how much efficiency you want and what you are willing to pay for it.\", '\"the amount of electricity required to keep cooling those refrigerants\" You don\\'t cool the refrigerants, they are cooled by changes in pressure via a compressor.', 'The cycle is run by electricity, so it is correct to say that electricity is needed to cool the refrigerants.', 'You might not quite understand how the physics of the heat pump works (BTW, exactly the same idea applies to \"air conditioners\").The compressor is needed to compress the refrigerant gas into a liquid. That makes the liquid much warmer, but the compressor is not there to heat that liquid; the compressor only compresses the gas into a liquid. The heat from that liquid is what heats the house.The now cooler liquid is allowed to expand inside the heat pump unit while it is exposed to outside air (or water for a geothermal installation), where the cold liquid extracts heat from the environment. The key here is to know that when a liquid expands into the gas phase, it must absorb energy, which it does frpm the outside air.The heat pump in winter effectively transfers heat from the outside air into the building this way. As outside temperature drops, the heat pump will get less efficient. But technology improvements have enabled new heat pumps to operate at colder temperatures than the older versions.', 'Your science is wrong.In either direction (inside to out or outside to in) the compressor heats the refrigerant, which goes through a coil to condense the hot gas into a cooler liquid and releasing heat out of the coil.Then it goes to another coil where it undergoes controlled expansion. That drops the temperature significantly, which drops the air temperature going over the coil while raising the temperature of the refrigerant that is being sucked back to the compressor to be recycled through the system again.We could improve the efficiency of this system by adding parts to make them task specific but also more complex. That would make it even more expensive and bulkier.Another point is that if the refrigerant cycle of the heat pump cannot keep the space temperature within 2 degrees of setpoint, most units will bring on the auxiliary resistance heat strips boosting electrical demand significantly.Also, they don’t draw heat inward, they draw air less cold than the refrigerant and sub-zero air tends to be very cold.Ever heard of absolute zero, where all molecular motion stops? The further above that you go the more molecular energy exists.Energy travels from the higher state to the lower state. Hot is the higher energy state and cold is lower state. The flow is always from high to low, or in this case hot to cold.Hot air does not rise on its own, it only appears to. Cold air is denser than hot air per volume, it contains more mass. Gravity pulls harder on the larger mass. Cold air is pulled toward the earth (the source of gravity) which, being denser with more mass, displaces any warmer air below it and forces it up.That is how baseboard heaters work. The heater warms the air inside its enclosure making it less dense and cold air pushes into the bottom and pushes the warm air out through the opening in the top. No fan required, physics makes it work.', 'My statement, which you you quote:Also, they don’t draw heat inward, they draw air less cold than the refrigerant and sub-zero air tends to be very cold.Your reply:Energy travels from the higher state to the lower state. Hot is the higher energy state and cold is lower state. The flow is always from high to low, or in this case hot to cold.Other than the very simplistic language I used, what’s exactly the difference between my statement and your reply?Just in case some of you have missed the point, this isn’t a discussion about the physics or the applications thereof but one of costs. My science is not wrong but if demonstrating your level of scientific knowledge to the tiniest of details makes some of you feel better about yourselves, go for it. As for myself, I don’t have much patience going down rabbit holes.In the Netherlands a brand new, super efficient gas boiler costs about €3k including installation, low maintenance costs and can last up to 20 years. On the other hand, a geothermal heat pump starts at €20k excluding installation, high maintenance costs but about the same life span. Air-to-air heat pumps start at €8k exclusive installation, have high maintenance costs and are good for about 10-12 years. In addition, you have the costs of making a dwelling fit for heat pump usage. Finally, you have the issue of electricity rates and taxes. Solar panels? Great where the sun shines when you need it. Will EVs help? The future will tell.Ultimately, my point remains the same: “Cheaper is not part of the picture.”Have a good weekend everyone!', 'Other than the very simplistic language I used, what’s exactly the difference between my statement and your reply?the amount of electricity required to keep cooling those refrigerants and operate the compressor which must heat that air again before it flows into an interior just keeps going up and up and up.As the outside temperature hits 41°F (5°C) and keeps falling, the amount of electricity required to keep cooling those refrigerants and operate the compressor which must heat that air again before it flows into an interior just keeps going up and up and up.The cooling effect occurs because you have a refrigerant gas that is compressed to a very high pressure and becomes quite warm, goes through a coil which removes some of that heat, and then goes to an expansion control device at the other coil that creates a large pressure drop which expands the gas and drops the temperature of the gas significantly.I commented because your \"correction\" of another commenter was vague, confusing and did not represent the physics that make heat pumps work. Your explanation makes it sound like the air is moving between inside and outside, which is not the case. The refrigerant travels between the inside unit and the outside unit while inside air is recirculated over the indoor coil and outside air is recirculated over the outdoor coil. In air conditioning mode the outside coil is the condenser and the inside coil is the evaporator. In heat pump mode the inside coil becomes the condenser and the outside coil becomes the evaporator.Sure I could have kept my knowledge to myself, but I thought some of the others who commented and did not seem to understand could benefit from it more than your explanation.

That means that there has to be positive air pressure up the flue, which means that there's negative air pressure in the house.

To run one of these units, it takes far more Kilowatt hours of energy than is needed to run a natural gas heater.What is happening in Germany right now is that nearly all new homes are being built with either heat pump or remote-warmth heating systems. To accomodate the higher energy needs to run them, the houses are being designed with the most up-to-date insulation systems as well, to reduce the need for heat. The author would be correct that this solution is a no-brainer for new construction.Without the necessary insulation renovation, though, a retrofitted heat pump can cost multiples to operate compared to a modern natural gas heater. The combination of the heat pump itself and the necessary insulation can push the costs of a retrofit for a single-family home in Germany upwards of 50,000 euros.A documentary on this I watched showed how a proper insulation upgrade alone could save tremendously on natural gas all by itself, without the heat pump, in the case of retrofitting. This considerably lengthens the time necessary to recover the cost of the retrofitted heat pump itself.Not to mention, a retrofit must be managed by a qualified engineer/planner, as each already-standing home is being upgraded from different standards and building codes.

I studied a thick GSHP installer's manual, scoured the internet for resources on specs and retrofits, and met with an energy efficiency consultant who installed one in his custom-built super-insulated home. Then I got bids from four heat pump installers. Why after all this did I install a 93% efficiency gas furnace instead? Furnaces produce hot air. Heat pumps generate warm air. Pumps have to move a whole lot more warm air to reach the same temp and require larger capacity ductwork than most older homes have. My ducts fit between the wall studs. If any heat pump tried to move enough warm air through my narrow ducts, I'd have whistling noises all over my home and the increased air resistance would completely shoot rosy efficiency and operating cost estimates to hell.

Second, a tree over 100 ft high shades my entire home from summer heat most of the day. If installers put in 3 to 5 wells and dug a trench from the well field to the house it would cut the roots and kill the tree. The same directional boring used to lay fiber optic cable might be able to run pipe without killing tree roots in the process (added cost) but even that's taking a risk. Hardly a good climate-saving strategy to destroy a mature tree that shades the width of two lots. It dropped below -10° F here last month. Air source heat pumps have improved a lot, but their efficiency ratings still fly out the window even faster than ground-source heat pumps in sub-zero temps.

For example, thermal power plants are inherently inefficient in generating electricity. Coal only 35% efficient and gas fired are a bit better in the 40 or 50% range. This, as I am sure you know, is because the high pressure steam driving the turbines must be allowed to condense to water releasing a hell of a lot of useless energy.

My boiler is supposed to be 96% efficient and doesn't even use a chimney. And still the heat pump is 5.5x more efficient? And I am using 5.5x the natural gas that the power plant uses to provide my electricity?One more point -- my heating bill in the winter is around $200/month. So my electric bill for a heat pump would only be around $36 being 5.5x as efficient? If that is true, sign me up.And one more not insignificant detail -- If the electricity goes out and I have a small portable gas generator, it is more than enough to run the pump on the boiler and I have heat! To energize a heat pump, I would need a massive and expensive Generac.For me the most relevant question would be how many therms of natural gas will I burn over a full heating season using my gas fired boiler vs how many therms the power company will burn to supply the electricity needed by a heat pump to produce the same level of comfort.\", \"Let's hope folks who take your advice don't have to use their wood stoves because they create toxic indoor air and are bad for the environment as well.

Some scientists believe there are opportunities with such a power source since fusion creates less radioactive material than fission and has a nearly unlimited fuel supply. However, progress is slow due to challenges with understanding how to control the reaction in a contained space.Both fission and fusion are nuclear reactions that produce energy, but the applications are not the same. Fission is the splitting of a heavy, unstable nucleus into two lighter nuclei, and fusion is the process where two light nuclei combine together releasing vast amounts of energy. Fission is used in nuclear power reactors since it can be controlled, while fusion is not utilized to produce power since the reaction is not easily controlled and is expensive to create the needed conditions for a fusion reaction. Research continues into ways to better harness the power of fusion, but research is in experimental stages. While different, the two processes have an important role in the past, present and future of energy creation.', 'Historically, nuclear reactors are much, much safer than fossil fuels when it comes to fatalities per unit of energy produced.

This is dangerous: a natural disaster at a site could be a catastrophe, and bad actors could potentially get their hands on the material. Politically, this appears unsolvable.The other problem is cost. Countries that have successfully deployed large scale nuclear (France, China, etc) have federally run power industries.

I wish that heat pumps were more efficient at low temperatures, but you risk alienating potential sustainability households by forcing them into a bad, uncomfortable option.\", 'You’re talking about older heat pumps. The current generation provides heat effectively and efficiently at temperatures below zero (Fahrenheit).', \"Jim, maybe a heat pump with with resistance heaters, i.e. pure electric with no heat pump efficiency, can keep a residence warm at subfreezing temperatures, but at what cost? Then you have the electricity transmission and heater strip losses to pay for. A forced air natural gas heater is much more thermodynamically efficient at low temperatures. Additionally, the grid is supplied by approximately 35% renewable energy, so the less efficient heat pumps will add to climate change! I wish that this wasn't so..\", \"Northern Colorado, front range resident here — installed a Carrier heat pump this summer, rated to –22°F (yes, negative 22°). Just went through the arctic blast with temps down to –12° locally, and it worked like a champ, no auxillery heating needed. It wasn't cheap — roughly 50% more expensive than replacing our outdated AC & furnace with new ones — but for us, it wasn't about the added expense. There are much bigger concerns that humans everywhere need to start accepting and addressing. Trying to do our part.\", \"Wow. Did it also work like a champ for the household members who always complain of being cold too? That's when I'll be a believer in the new ones hahaha.\", 'I’m in Littleton, and I’m looking to buy a heat pump this year now that the IRA and Excel Energy are offering rebates and tax credits. What’s the model number of your Carrier?For those of you interested in what the IRA has to offer in the way of rebates and tax credits, check out the Rewiring America website, https://www.rewiringamerica.org/', \"Imagine electrifying every home in Texas with their shaky power system. Imagine the Hoover dam having no water to run the turbines. There's a lot of bugs to work out on the national plan.\", \"Imagine solarizing every home in Texas. That's one way to address the shaky power system.\", 'maybe the most expensive upfront, yet in the long term the geothermal heat pump is the future. A geothermal heat pump extracts heat from the ground instead of the air. Because the temperature of the ground is much warmer and consistent, this equates to more consistent heat to the heat pump despite colder outdoor temperatures. These types of heat pumps don’t need a back-up heat course such as heat strips or a furnace.', 'But not feasible for dense urban or suburban areas though.', 'Not feasible for southern states with high water tables as well. Remember that we in the southern states need the opposite end - air conditioning to survive the getting hotter summers. This last summer in Florida was brutal.', 'The only person I know with geothermal heat lives in semi-rural area, on five acres of land.', 'Like so many things, depends on what dollar value you consider feasible. They can do more vertical setups if the land is small, but the price is higher. Either way, you are probably upper single thousands if your house is already built when you factor in the drilling and repairing the land or wherever they have to drill. I would like to do ground source, but in the dc area it is probably not worth the expense for the very few days of extreme lows and highs we get.', 'I can see a day coming quickly when developers will have entire new neighborhoods set up for heat pumps.', \"Well, its nice to know these systems save energy. But my landlord recently installed a new hot water system here attached to a heat pump and I hate the damn thing. It's not far from my bedroom window, the fan is big and noisy and it drones on and on and on through the wee small hours. I've learned to tune it out as best as I can, but I consider noise pollution to be a major problem of modern life and to have my beautiful quiet nights taken away like this is very upsetting.\", 'Do you have access to the control panel? It can be switched to run on the heating elements like a traditional water heater. Defeats the whole efficiency aspect of the heat pump but if it bothers you that much... Maybe switch it before going to bed. It can also be put on a schedule but you need the app for that.', \"It's insane. So everyone is supposed to have a heat pump and an electric car. Well the electric cost per kilowatt just went up 300% in my town. This is not going to work and we will all be slaves to the electric company. Plus where does electricity come from - Coal and Oil mostly!\", '49% of the electricity from the electric utility in my state comes from carbon free sources. Serves 1.3 million people.', 'Moral high ground achieved. Congratulations!🎉', 'Because the government will give them money?', \"Because they don't know physics?\", 'Thanks for the explanation. Very clear and informative.Would we be expected to have a backup (fossil fuel) heat source for power outages? Not a rhetorical question…genuinely curious about it.', 'All fossil fuel heating sources require electricity. I think that answers the question. Technology and science will advance whether the troglodytes object or not. History has shown that the Luddites did not prevail.', 'That is the answer.A gas furnace requires electricity to operate so it is no different during a power failure.We have a gas fireplace which does not require electricity and gives a bit of heat when power is out.We also have solar and a Tesla battery and have not been without power for years.', 'A modern hot-air gas furnace has electric controls/ignition and fan that can be run off a 120V circuit (providing it’s installed that way). This can facilitate reasonable home heating using a portable generator to power that circuit.However, running a heat pump during a power outage would require a comparatively huge generator, using much more (shudder) fossil fuel.', 'My gas stove has electronic ignition, but during a power failure, I just turn on the gas and light the burner with a match.', 'We have a ground source (geothermal) heat pump for our home. We have a portable gas-powered generator for outages, mainly because we use a well for water. So we need power if we want water.For heat we could use our wood stove.', 'And wood is renewable. Currently wood and solar supply the same amount of US energy.', \"Won't be true in five years.I live in a net zero energy home, with a grid tied 5.4-kW rooftop PV system.\", 'Wood might be renewable but it is a significant source of pollution. That campfire smell is the smoke you are smelling, which can even be carcinogenic. There are some pellet stoves that are much more efficient and far less polluting, if you need a non-electric backup heating system.', 'You should always have a fossil fuel alternative available if you live in a cold climate.', 'Provided it does not require electricity.', 'It would depend on how cold it gets and how well insulated your house is. If you have a well sealed and insulated house and it doesn’t get super cold, you may be fine for a day or more with no heat. If you have one of the smarter thermostats, you could get a rough idea by seeing your usage on cold days or turning the system off on a cold day and see how long it takes to drop temperature and to what temperature.If you are counting on a gas fireplace to keep you warm, it is a mixed bag. If you are ok sleeping in your living room or where the fireplace is, maybe, but it is probably not keeping your house as a whole warm unless your house is already well insulated anyway. This also requires gas service to your house which has minimum charges. If you have gas for something else that might not matter, but if you are moving away from gas you’d have to consider alternatives. A gas generator can work to power your system but you do have to take the time to maintain it and be sure your gasoline doesn’t degrade while idle.Due to all that hassle, I’ve been considering battery backup systems like generac or powerwall. I would probably want to do it the same time as a solar power install, but you don’t have to do it that way.Or if your house isn’t well insulated now, you might want to start there since it will save you money in heating and cooling and then the heat pump becomes more useful as well since they don’t churn out heat, a poorly insulated house leads to an unsatisfactory experience.', 'Battery backup for a PV system is very expensive right now. When I looked at that I considered the frequency of power outages, and went for the much less expensive gasoline-powered portable generator. I have the house wired to plug the generator in and backfeed the main bus. Maintaining the generator is pretty simple, cranking it up once every 2-3 months and letting it run for 15 minutes or so.', 'That’s a perfectly reasonable route. I don’t have any other gas powered devices around, so I’m less inclined to keep a tank around for a once a year/every other year event. I’ve seen a guy use a propane based generator since it stays stable for longer than gasoline.I place a some value on instant switchover. I consider battery to be more valuable for demand shifting with a pv setup for the early evening based on getting a full charge during the day. I don’t think I can really justify even a cheap generator for how rarely we lose power when there’s nothing critical other than fridges. I haven’t been able to justify a pv setup either yet, but we’ll see with the new incentives. Thanks for the information. It gives me more to consider.', 'Think wood burning stove. Or a back up generator.', \"You mean like a fireplace or a Franklin stove? Because furnaces go down during power outages, too. Best bet, solar panels to supply heat. Of course small diesel or gas heaters would work in a pinch, too, just like they do now, again, when your main fossil furnace can't function during an outage.\", 'forumTop of comments']\n"
